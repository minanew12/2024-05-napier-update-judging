# PufETHAdapter has not implemented withdrawal functions

## Summary
There are many NatSpec comments stating that `Puffer does not have a withdrawal function yet`. However, this is not true.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
/// @dev Puffer doesn't have withdraw function yet.
    function requestWithdrawal() external pure override {
        revert NotImplemented();
    }
```
In the older version of `PufferVault.sol`, the withdraw and redeem functions were indeed not implemented:
```solidity
/**
     * @notice Not allowed
     */
    function redeem(uint256, address, address) public virtual override returns (uint256) {
        revert WithdrawalsAreDisabled();
    }

    /**
     * @notice Not allowed
     */
    function withdraw(uint256, address, address) public virtual override returns (uint256) {
        revert WithdrawalsAreDisabled();
    }
```

However, in the new version, `PufferVaultV2.sol`, these functions are now present.
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner)
        public
        virtual
        override
        revertIfDeposited
        restricted
        returns (uint256)
    {
        uint256 maxAssets = maxWithdraw(owner);
        if (assets > maxAssets) {
            revert ERC4626ExceededMaxWithdraw(owner, assets, maxAssets);
        }

        _updateDailyWithdrawals(assets);

        _wrapETH(assets);

        uint256 shares = previewWithdraw(assets);
        _withdraw({ caller: _msgSender(), receiver: receiver, owner: owner, assets: assets, shares: shares });

        return shares;
    }

    function redeem(uint256 shares, address receiver, address owner)
        public
        virtual
        override
        revertIfDeposited
        restricted
        returns (uint256)
    {
        uint256 maxShares = maxRedeem(owner);
        if (shares > maxShares) {
            revert ERC4626ExceededMaxRedeem(owner, shares, maxShares);
        }

        uint256 assets = previewRedeem(shares);

        _updateDailyWithdrawals(assets);

        _wrapETH(assets);

        _withdraw({ caller: _msgSender(), receiver: receiver, owner: owner, assets: assets, shares: shares });

        return assets;
    }
```

The only action required from the Puffer protocol is to allow everyone to call these functions, as there is currently a `restricted` modifier that functions similarly to the `whenNotPaused` modifier from `Pausable.sol`.
Essentially, the Puffer protocol will allow withdrawals soon by changing access to the functions
```solidity
* @dev Restricted in this context is like `whenNotPaused` modifier from Pausable.sol
```

## Impact
The Napier protocol stated that Puffer doesn't have a withdrawal function yet, which is why they didn't implement withdrawal functions. However, this is not true.

## Recommendation
The [PufferVaultV2.sol](https://etherscan.io/token/0xD9A442856C234a39a81a089C06451EBAa4306a72) address hasn't changed, only the implementation has. Consider implementing withdrawal functions.
