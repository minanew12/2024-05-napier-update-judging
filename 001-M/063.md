# `_stake()` function in `PufEthAdapter` will always revert

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The [PufETHAdapter::_stake()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/main/napier-uups-adapters/src/adapters/puffer/PufETHAdapter.sol#L66) function deposits `stETH` into Puffer via the following call:

```solidity
uint256 _pufETHAmt = PUFFER_DEPOSITOR.depositStETH(Permit(block.timestamp, _stETHAmt, 0, 0, 0));
```

This will always revert because the function `depositStETH` of `PUFFER_DEPOSITOR` takes two parameters as inputs: a `Permit` struct, and a receiver `address`. Only the first parameter is passed by Napier, this means Napier will attempt to call a function that doesn't exist making the whole transaction revert.

This can be verified by looking at the currently deployed [PUFFER_DEPOSITOR](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4aA799C5dfc01ee7d790e3bf1a7C2257CE1DcefF#writeProxyContract). The address is hardcoded in the [Constants.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/main/napier-uups-adapters/src/Constants.sol#L19C34-L19C76) file.

## Impact

The [PufETHAdapter::_stake()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/main/napier-uups-adapters/src/adapters/puffer/PufETHAdapter.sol#L66) will always revert and funds can't be deposited, rendering the contract useless.

## Recommendation

Adjust the `IPufferDepositor` interface and pass `address(this)` as second parameter when calling `depositStETH`:

```solidity
uint256 _pufETHAmt = PUFFER_DEPOSITOR.depositStETH(Permit(block.timestamp, _stETHAmt, 0, 0, 0), address(this));
```
