# `PufETHAdapter` uses the incorrect function signature for staking

## Summary
`PufETHAdapter._stake()` used for staking stETH to the `PUFFER_DEPOSITOR` contract. However, the function `depositStETH` utilize has incorrect signature. 
## Vulnerability Detail
In `Constants.sol`, we can check the version utilize by the adapter of the deposit contract `0x4aA799C5dfc01ee7d790e3bf1a7C2257CE1DcefF` is v2, the function signature for the v2 should be

```solidity
    function depositStETH(Permit calldata permitData, address recipient) external returns (uint256 pufETHAmount);
```
However, this is not what used by the `PufETHAdapter` contract,

```solidity
        // Stake stETH to PufferDepositor
        uint256 _pufETHAmt = PUFFER_DEPOSITOR.depositStETH(Permit(block.timestamp, _stETHAmt, 0, 0, 0));  // @audit-issue signature from v1
```

it has the missing `address` parameter. As a result, the stETH deposit to puffer will always reverts.
## Impact
After the `targetETHbuffer` filled, excess ETH amount cannot be utilize to stake further.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace IPufferDepositor with v2 [interface](https://github.com/PufferFinance/pufETH/blob/main/src/interface/IPufferDepositorV2.sol) . And use the `address(this)` as `receiver`
