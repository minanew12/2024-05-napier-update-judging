# The _stake function in the PufETHAdapter will always fail

## Summary
The `PufETHAdapter` smart contract attempts to call the `depositStETH` function in the `Puffer Depositor` smart contract, but as indicated in the title, this call will always fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here's what happens when a user calls the `issue` function in `Tranche.sol` with the `PufETHAdapter` adapter:
```solidity
issue
   adapter.prefundedDeposit()
      _stake
         PUFFER_DEPOSITOR.depositStETH
```

The `PufETHAdapter` interacts with `PUFFER_DEPOSITOR` (`0x4aA799C5dfc01ee7d790e3bf1a7C2257CE1DcefF`) and makes the following call:
```solidity
PUFFER_DEPOSITOR.depositStETH(Permit(block.timestamp, _stETHAmt, 0, 0, 0));
```
However, if we look at the `depositStETH` function, it takes two arguments:
```solidity
function depositStETH(Permit calldata permitData, address recipient)
```

Therefore, the `depositStETH` call will always fail because the function is being called with only one argument, missing the `address recipient`.

## Impact
Users cannot make deposits into the Puffer protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider calling the `depositStETH` function with two arguments: `Permit permitData` and `address recipient`.
