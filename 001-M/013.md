# `pufETHAdapter` will not work as it calls inexistent function

## Summary
The adapter tries to call a function which does not exist

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the `_stake` function, the adapter tries to call the following function
```solidity
        // Stake stETH to PufferDepositor
        uint256 _pufETHAmt = PUFFER_DEPOSITOR.depositStETH(Permit(block.timestamp, _stETHAmt, 0, 0, 0));
```

However, function with such selector does not actually exist. If we look at the actual `depositSTETH` function in the contract, we'll see that it accepts two arguments - a permit struct and an address.
