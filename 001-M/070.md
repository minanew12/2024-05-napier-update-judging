# `PufETHAdapter` use wrong deposit function signature from outdated depositor interface

## Summary

The `PufETHAdapter` contract in the `_stake` function uses the Puffer protocol's depositor to deposit funds via the `depositStETH()` function. However, the function signature used in the local interface does not match the current version deployed on the mainnet, leading to potential issues when calling the function.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `PufETHAdapter` relies on a local interface for the depositor, which is initialized with a constant address. However, the contract at this address has been updated to a new version (v2), where the function signature of `depositStETH()` has been changed and does not inherit from the previous version.

In the local interface, the `depositStETH()` function is assumed to have the signature from v1, but the contract on the mainnet now has a different signature in v2.

**Constant Initialization and Local Interface:**

```solidity
File: napier-uups-adapters/src/Constants.sol
18: // @notice puffer depositor address on mainnet
19: address constant PUF_DEPOSITOR = 0x4aA799C5dfc01ee7d790e3bf1a7C2257CE1DcefF;
```

```solidity
File: napier-uups-adapters/src/adapters/puffer/PufETHAdapter.sol
28:     /// @notice Puffer Depositor
29:     IPufferDepositor constant PUFFER_DEPOSITOR = IPufferDepositor(Constants.PUF_DEPOSITOR);
```

**Incorrect Function Call in `_stake`:**

```solidity
File: napier-uups-adapters/src/adapters/puffer/PufETHAdapter.sol
81:         // Stake stETH to PufferDepositor
82:         uint256 _pufETHAmt = PUFFER_DEPOSITOR.depositStETH(Permit(block.timestamp, _stETHAmt, 0, 0, 0)); //@audit wrong function signature
```

**Updated Function Signature in v2:**

```solidity
67:    function depositStETH(Permit calldata permitData, address recipient)
```

The mismatch in function signatures can lead to failed transactions when attempting to deposit assets using the `PufETHAdapter`.

## Impact

This vulnerability can cause deposit transactions to fail, preventing users from depositing their assets as intended (DoS).

## Code Snippet

Here is the incorrect function call in the `PufETHAdapter`:

```solidity
File: napier-uups-adapters/src/adapters/puffer/PufETHAdapter.sol
81:         // Stake stETH to PufferDepositor
82:         uint256 _pufETHAmt = PUFFER_DEPOSITOR.depositStETH(Permit(block.timestamp, _stETHAmt, 0, 0, 0)); //@audit wrong function signature
```

And the expected correct function signature in the updated v2 contract:

```solidity
67:    function depositStETH(Permit calldata permitData, address recipient)
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

### Update the Adapter to Match the New Interface

1. **Update the Local Interface:** Ensure that the local interface used in `PufETHAdapter` matches the function signatures of the updated v2 contract.

2. **Modify the `_stake` Function:** Adjust the `_stake` function in `PufETHAdapter` to use the correct function signature for `depositStETH()`, including the additional `recipient` parameter.

### Example of Corrected Code

**Updated Local Interface:**

```solidity
interface IPufferDepositor {
    function depositStETH(Permit calldata permitData, address recipient) external returns (uint256);
}
```

**Corrected `_stake` Function:**

```solidity
File: napier-uups-adapters/src/adapters/puffer/PufETHAdapter.sol
81:         // Stake stETH to PufferDepositor
82:         uint256 _pufETHAmt = PUFFER_DEPOSITOR.depositStETH(Permit(block.timestamp, _stETHAmt, 0, 0, 0), address(this)); //@audit correct function signature
```

By ensuring that the `PufETHAdapter` uses the correct function signatures, the protocol can prevent failed transactions and maintain proper functionality.
