# Contracts are vulnerable to fee-on-transfer accounting-related issues

## Summary
The function swap in the smart contract facilitates the swapping of uniETH for WETH using the Uniswap V3 protocol. It involves transferring uniETH from the caller to the contract and then executing a swap to convert uniETH to WETH, ensuring the caller receives at least a minimum specified amount of WETH.
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
`Incorrect Transfer`: If uniETH is not correctly transferred from the caller to the contract, the swap cannot be executed properly.
`Insufficient Return`: If the caller does not receive the minimum expected amount of WETH, they might incur a loss or receive less value than anticipated.
`Loss of Funds`: Any discrepancies in token balances could lead to loss of funds or improper execution of the swap, affecting the trust and reliability of the contract.

## Recommendation
Implement Balance Checks: Ensure the function includes thorough checks for the token balances before and after the swap.
