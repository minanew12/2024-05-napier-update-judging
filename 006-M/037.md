# `rsETHPrice()` may return an outdated price

## Summary

In the `prefundedDeposit()` function, the protocol calls `totalAssets()` to estimate the assets. When the adapter is `RsETHAdapter`, the protocol does not invoke `updateRSETHPrice()` to update the price, potentially resulting in an outdated calculation and users receiving more shares than expected.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `BaseLSTAdapterUpgradeable.prefundedDeposit()` function, the protocol first calculates `targetBufferEth` using the following method. 
```solidity

     uint256 targetBufferEth = ((totalAssets() + assets) * $.targetBufferPercentage) / BUFFER_PERCENTAGE_PRECISION;

```


Next, after minting shares to `msg.sender`, it calculates `availableEth` using the following method. 

```solidity
  _mint(msg.sender, shares);

        uint256 availableEth = bufferEthCache + assets; // non-zero

```

Then, it computes `stakeAmount` as follows: 
```solidity
stakeAmount = availableEth + queueEthCache - targetBufferEth.
```

Finally, it calls `_stake()` to deposit into the yield source.
```solidity
        /// INTERACT ///
        // Deposit into the yield source
        // Actual amount of ETH spent may be less than the requested amount.
        stakeAmount = _stake(stakeAmount); // stake amount can be 0

```

When the adapter is `RsETHAdapter`, let's examine the `totalAssets()` function. In this function, the protocol calculates total assets as `totalQueueEth + bufferEth + (RSETH.balanceOf(address(this)) * RSETH_ORACLE.rsETHPrice()) / 1e18`.
```solidity
    function totalAssets() public view override returns (uint256) {
        LSTAdapterStorage storage $ = _getStorage();
        return $.totalQueueEth + $.bufferEth + (RSETH.balanceOf(address(this)) * RSETH_ORACLE.rsETHPrice()) / 1e18;
    }

```
Now, looking at the `RSETH_ORACLE` contract, we find that `rsETHPrice` is a global variable. To update this value, one needs to call the `updateRSETHPrice()` function.

```solidity
 function updateRSETHPrice() external {
        address rsETHTokenAddress = lrtConfig.rsETH();
        uint256 rsEthSupply = IRSETH(rsETHTokenAddress).totalSupply();

        if (rsEthSupply == 0) {
            rsETHPrice = 1 ether;
            return;
        }

        uint256 totalETHInPool;
        address lrtDepositPoolAddr = lrtConfig.getContract(LRTConstants.LRT_DEPOSIT_POOL);

        address[] memory supportedAssets = lrtConfig.getSupportedAssetList();
        uint256 supportedAssetCount = supportedAssets.length;

        for (uint16 asset_idx; asset_idx < supportedAssetCount;) {
            address asset = supportedAssets[asset_idx];
            uint256 assetER = getAssetPrice(asset);

            uint256 totalAssetAmt = ILRTDepositPool(lrtDepositPoolAddr).getTotalAssetDeposits(asset);
            totalETHInPool += totalAssetAmt * assetER;

            unchecked {
                ++asset_idx;
            }
        }

        rsETHPrice = totalETHInPool / rsEthSupply;
    }

```


 However, the protocol does not invoke this function, potentially resulting in an outdated price. If this outdated price is lower than expected, `targetBufferEth` will be smaller than anticipated, leading to a larger `stakeAmount = availableEth + queueEthCache - targetBufferEth`. Consequently, the `_stake()` function will acquire more `rsETH`, ultimately resulting in users receiving more shares.

## Impact
The protocol has not updated rsETHPrice, which may be an outdated price. This results in inaccurate calculations by the protocol, potentially leading to users receiving more shares than expected.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to call the `updateRSETHPrice()` function before invoking the `totalAssets()` function to update the value of `rsETHPrice`.
