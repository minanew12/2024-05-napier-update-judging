# The `RenzoAdapter.sol` contract doesn't check for the current staking limit in the `_stake` function

## Summary
The  `RenzoAdapter.sol` contract is supposed to check the current staking limit in the `_stake` function to prevent Denial of Service but it doesn't.

## Vulnerability Detail
As it is said in the natspec the `_stake` function needs to check the current staking limit to prevent DoS but it doesn't. When the `stakeAmount` is specified if it is more than the current staking limit, the function is supposed to set the `stakeAmount` as the staking limit. By doing this the function prevents DoS. But in this case, the `_stake` function doesn't have the check for the current staking limit and the `stakeAmount` can be whatever is specified which can be way more than the staking limit.

## Impact
Not having the check for the current staking limit in the function can lead to DoS. The attacker can overwhelm the network by sending more traffic that depletes the memory and bandwidth of the server.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Put a check in the function which checks if the `stakeAmount` is more than the `stakeLimit` and if it is make the `stakeAmount` the same as the `stakeLimit`.

This is an example of how it can be done:
```solidity
        uint256 stakeLimit = EZETH.getCurrentStakeLimit();
        if (stakeAmount > stakeLimit) {
            // Cap stake amount
            stakeAmount = stakeLimit;
        }
```
