# `swapETHForYt` will revert even if contract has enough ETH to repay flashloan and refund remaining to user

## Summary
In line 346 below, the check `repayAmount > remaining` is wrong, becasue it triggers a revert on correct swap cases too.
The check makes sure if flashloan can be repaid with user's `msg.value`, but reverts on swap cases even if flashloan can be repaid with enough ETH in the contract (`msg.value` + PT swapped `wethReceived`)Â

## Vulnerability Detail

Look at the line with a red flag (ðŸš©ðŸš© Â Bug) mentioned below, that is the bug.

**Issue flow** :
1. As per tests, maxEthSpent = (ytAmount * 15) / 10
2. A user wants to swap 1.5 ETH ($4500) for this 1 YT tokens expected.
3. So user calls `MetapoolRouter.swapETHForYt` with 1 YT expected, maxETH spent = 1.5 ETH, `msg.value` = 1.5 ETH.
4. line 247 will calculate how much ETH is needed to issue 1 YT and 1 PT, and this `wethDeposit` will be flashloaned.
5. Depending on PT/YT scales/rates, the returned value can be 10 ETH or even 2 ETH depending on PT/YT scales.
6. for example let's say, 10 eth was `wethDeposit`, and it is flashloaned. And 1 PT + 1 YT will be issued, and that 1 PT is now swapped to tricrypto LP
7. That tricypto LP was swapped back to ETH which will be `wethReceived` in line 311. In this case, let `wethReceived` = 8.7 ETH for swapping 1 PT.

so now, repayAmount = wethDeposit + feeAmounts[0], repayAmount = 10 + 0.1 eth fee = 10.1 ETH
spent = repayAmount - wethReceived = 10.1 ETH- 8.7 ETH , spent = 1.4 ETH
so only, remaining = TSLOT_CB_DATA_VALUE - spent = 1.5 ETH - 1.4 ETH, remaining = 0.1 ETH.

So right now there is 1.5 ETH (msg.value) + 1 YT + 8.7 ETH (`wethReceived` ) = 10.2 ETH + 1 YT and we owe 10.1 ETH for balancer flashoan, and 0.1 ETH will be remaining. The swap should not revert now due to lack of ETH balance to repay flashloan, because we have more than 10.1 ETH

ðŸš©ðŸš© Â Bug :
Swap will revert because `repayAmount > remaining` is true.
`10.1 ETH > 0.1 ETH == true` triggers the revert `MetapoolRouterInsufficientETHRepay`, this validation is meaning less because with current ETH balance, the flashloan can be repaid. 
This swap succeeds only if line 346 passes and according to line 361, this 0.1 eth is sent back as refund. And line 358 repays the flash loan of 10.1 ETH `repayAmount`. 1 YT is sent to recipient on line 355.
So contract is now empty and all conditions are satisfied.

## Impact

Swaps `swapETHForYt` will fail in more than 7/10  cases. so High impact with high likelihood.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove that validation, because it serves no purpose. The transaction will revert automatically if the flashloan cannot be repaid because the contract won't have enough weth balance to do both flashloan repayment and remaining refund to swapper.
