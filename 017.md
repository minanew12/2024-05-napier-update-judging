# `BaseLSTAdapterUpgradeable` and `BaseLSTVaultUpgradeable` don't disable initializers as another layer of security.

## Summary
`BaseLSTAdapterUpgradeable` and `BaseLSTVaultUpgradeable` don't disable initializers first as another layer of security and then run the initialize functions.

## Vulnerability Detail 
The contracts do have initialize functions but they don't disable the initializers first in the constructor. It is recommended to have both the _disableInitializer constructor and initialize function. The constructor is to disable the implementation contract from being initialized, while the initializer function is to allow the proxy to be initialized. Putting it in the constructor, prevents initialization of the implementation contract itself, as extra protection to prevent an attacker from initializing it. By disabling initializers first, we add an extra layer of security. Doing this also has the benefit of preventing users from using the implementation directly, and helps prevent others from overtaking the implementation in general. This isn't strictly needed, but it is recommended as a best practice to have more protection and to make the contracts less vulnerable to attacks.

## Impact
An attacker can take over an uninitialized implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, invoke the _disableInitializers function in the constructor to lock it when it is deployed automatically. By running _disableInitializer in the constructor first and then running the initialization function we prevent initialization of the implementation contract itself and attackers can't initialize it.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make a constructor that disables the initializers and then run the function which initializes.

For example:
```solidity
constructor() {
_disableInitializers();
}
```
