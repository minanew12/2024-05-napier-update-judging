# Lack of ETH Handling

## Summary

The contract BaseLSTVaultUpgradeable.sol works with native Ether, but it has no methods to handle Ether.

## Vulnerability Detail

 In case, the contract invoked by another contract along with the Ether transfer, any Ethers transferred would be stuck in this contract permanently.  

## Impact

Lost of funds for users

```solidity
receive() external payable  {
    //fallback function to receive Ethers
}
```
