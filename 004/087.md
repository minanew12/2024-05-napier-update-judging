# Unchecked ERC20 transfers can cause lock up

## Summary
Some major tokens went live before ERC20 was finalised, resulting in a discrepancy whether the transfer functions a) should return a boolean or b) revert/fail on error. The current best practice is that they should revert, but return “true” on success. However, not every token claiming ERC20-compatibility is doing this — some only return true/false; some revert, but do not return anything on success. This is a well known issue, heavily discussed since mid-2018.

Today many tools, including OpenZeppelin, offer a wrapper for “safe ERC20 transfer”: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol
## Vulnerability Detail
  

        IERC20(pt.yieldToken()).transfer(recipient, pyAmount);
    
## Impact
transfer may fail.
