# Wrong checking causes the swapETHForYt function to revert with a high probability

## Summary
When the swapETHForYt function is called to perform swap, the contract will borrow money through flash loans. The relationship [between repayAmount and remaining is incorrectly checked](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/c31af59c6399182fd04b40530d79d98632d2bfa7/metapool-router/src/MetapoolRouter.sol#L333) in the flash loan callback function receiveFlashLoan, which causes swap to fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the receiveFlashLoan function, [remaining ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/c31af59c6399182fd04b40530d79d98632d2bfa7/metapool-router/src/MetapoolRouter.sol#L332)represents the remaining ETH sent by the user to the contract for swap, which will eventually be returned to the user. The [repayAmount ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/c31af59c6399182fd04b40530d79d98632d2bfa7/metapool-router/src/MetapoolRouter.sol#L324C17-L324C29)indicates the amount of flash loan to be repaid by the agreement. Generally speaking, repayAmount will be greater than remaining, so there is a high probability that revert will occur here. This causes swap to fail.

## Impact
Wrong checking causes the swapETHForYt function to revert with a high probability

## Code Snippet
```solidity
        uint256 remaining = TransientStorage.tloadU256(TSLOT_CB_DATA_VALUE) - spent;
        if (repayAmount > remaining) revert Errors.MetapoolRouterInsufficientETHRepay(); // Can't repay the flash loan
```

## Recommendation
