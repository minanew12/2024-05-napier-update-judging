# more shares can be minted even when staking is paused

## Summary
more shares can be minted even when staking is paused

## Vulnerability Detail
When staking is paused, it is still possible to mint new shares. As a result, the number of shares minted can exceed the amount staked.

## Impact
One significant impact of this vulnerability is observed in the `prefundedRedeem` function. This function relies on the number of shares minted to determine the amount of assets to transfer. If the number of shares minted is higher than the WETH (Wrapped Ether) deposited, it leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack because the `prefundedRedeem` function can no longer be executed

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff
 /// WRITE ///
-        _mint(msg.sender, shares);

        uint256 availableEth = bufferEthCache + assets; // non-zero

        // If the buffer is insufficient or staking is paused, doesn't stake any of the deposit
        StakeLimitTypes.Data memory data = $.packedStakeLimitData.getStorageStakeLimitStruct();
        if (targetBufferEth >= availableEth + queueEthCache || data.isStakingPaused()) {
            /// WRITE ///
            $.bufferEth = availableEth.toUint128();
            return (assets, shares);
        }
+       _mint(msg.sender, shares);
```
