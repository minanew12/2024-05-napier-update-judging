# `MetapoolIRouter.sol` lacks withdrawal and swap functionalities for YT tokens

## Summary

Users' YT tokens are indefinitely locked within the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The current implementation of `MetapoolIRouter.sol` presents a critical issue: it doesn't include functions for withdrawing or swapping YT tokens. Consequently, users' YT tokens are permanently locked within the contract, rendering them inaccessible. This issue needs to be promptly addressed to ensure the functionality and usability of the `MetapoolIRouter.sol` contract.

## Impact

The lack of essential functionalities impedes users from utilizing the contract as intended. The inability to withdraw accrued interest diminishes user motivation to engage with the application.
