# Re-entrancy Vulnerabilities in BaseLSTAdapter

## Summary

The contract BaseLSTAdapter.sol implements a _Liquid Staking Token Adapter_ making use of OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` modifier to prevent re-entrancy attacks. 

## Vulnerability Detail

However, the functions `prefundedRedeem()`, `claimWithdrawal()`, `setStakingLimit()`, `pauseStaking()`, and `unpauseStaking()` don't make use of any re-entrancy guarding mechanism. These functions include external calls in the form of token transfers (`IWETH9(WETH).transfer()`) and could potentially be vulnerable to a re-entrancy attack if called by malicious contracts. 

## Impact

In specific situations, these external calls might be exploited to call the function again before the first call is finished, possibly leading to unexpected behaviour or loss of funds.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/main/napier-v1/src/adapters/BaseLSTAdapter.sol#L168-L191


```solidity
/// @notice Handles prefunded redemptions
/// @dev Withdraw from the buffer. If the buffer is insufficient, revert with an error
/// @param recipient The address to receive the redeemed WETH
/// @return The amount of redeemed WETH
/// @return The amount of shares burned
function prefundedRedeem(address recipient) external virtual onlyTranche returns (uint256, uint256) {
    // ...
    /// INTERACT ///
    IWETH9(WETH).transfer(recipient, assets);
    // ...
}
```

The code snippet from the `prefundedRedeem()` function shows an external call to transfer tokens to a recipient, which could potentially lead to a re-entrancy attack if the recipient is a malicious contract.

## Recommendation

Implement the nonReentrant modifier in these functions.
