# Minimum ETH Withdrawal Requirement Causes Delayed Requests

## Summary
Withdrawals can't happen until the contract has 100 ether, making it hard to use at first.

## Vulnerability Detail
The ``_requestWithdrawal function ``implements  a minimum`` withdrawAmount ``of 100 ether, potentially delaying the initiation of withdrawal requests until the contract's balance reaches the specified threshold. it will make hard for  users, especially those trying  to withdraw smaller amounts, and may hinder the contract's initial usability.
```solidity
 function _requestWithdrawal(uint256 withdrawAmount) internal override returns (uint256, uint256) {
        // The max amount for a request is 500 ether to chunk the large withdrawals into smaller ones.
        if (withdrawAmount < 100) revert WithdrawalBelowMinimum(); // here
        if (withdrawAmount > 500 ether) withdrawAmount = 500 ether;
```

## Impact
users won't be able to withdraw their funds until the contract has 100 ether, causing inconvenience and delays.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that users can withdraw smaller amounts by adjusting the minimum withdrawal threshold to allow for more flexibility in accessing funds.
```solidity
    function _requestWithdrawal(uint256 withdrawAmount) internal override returns (uint256, uint256) {
        // The max amount for a request is 500 ether to chunk the large withdrawals into smaller ones.
       --  if (withdrawAmount < 100) revert WithdrawalBelowMinimum();
        ++  if (withdrawAmount > EETH.balanceOf(address(this))) revert();
        if (withdrawAmount > 500 ether) withdrawAmount = 500 ether;

        /// INTERACT ///
        // The amount of ether that will be withdrawn is limited to
        // the number of eETH tokens transferred to this contract at the moment of request.
        // So, we will not receive the rewards for the period of time while these tokens stay in the queue.
        uint256 _requestId = LIQUIDITY_POOL.requestWithdraw(address(this), withdrawAmount); // Dev: Ensure id is not 0
        if (_requestId == 0) revert InvariantViolation(); 

        emit RequestWithdrawal(_requestId, withdrawAmount);
        return (withdrawAmount, _requestId);
    }
```
