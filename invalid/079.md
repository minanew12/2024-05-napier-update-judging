# EETHAdapter.totalAssets() returns wrong value

## Summary
`EETHAdapter.totalAssets()` returns wrong value and this can affect `BaseLSTAdaper.prefundedDeposit()` and `Tranche.issue()`.


## Vulnerability Detail
`EETHAdapter.totalAssets()` returns the sum of `totalQueueEth`, `bufferEth` and `eEthBalance`. 

```solidity
EETHAdapter.sol
129:     function totalAssets() public view override returns (uint256) {
130:         uint256 eEthBalance = EETH.balanceOf(address(this));
131:         return totalQueueEth + bufferEth + eEthBalance; 
132:     }
```
The problem is `totalQueueEth` and `bufferEth` are in terms of `ETH`, but `eEthBalance` is in terms of `EETH`. `EETH` is `ether.fi Staked ETH`, and the price `EETH` is not the same as `ETH`. 1 `EETH` is almost 1 `ETH` in most cases, but it can vary from 0.88 `ETH` to 1.3 `ETH` in some cases. As a result, `EETHAdapter.totalAssets()` returns wrong value and this can affect `BaseLSTAdaper.prefundedDeposit()` and `Tranche.issue()`. `Tranche.issue()` is very important in Napier protocol so this error can affect overall workflow of Napier protocol.

## Impact
`EETHAdapter.totalAssets()` returns wrong value and `Tranche.issue()` might not work as intended.
