# `RsETHAdapter` adapter `_stake()` function lacks slippage control

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The function [RsETHAdapter::_stake()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/main/napier-uups-adapters/src/adapters/kelp/RsETHAdapter.sol#L67) deposits assets into Kelp by calling the `depositETH` function:
```solidity
    function _stake(uint256 stakeAmount) internal override returns (uint256) {
        ...SNIP...
        // Interact
        IWETH9(Constants.WETH).withdraw(stakeAmount);
        uint256 _rsETHAmt = RSETH.balanceOf(address(this));
@>      RSETH_DEPOSIT_POOL.depositETH{value: stakeAmount}(0, REFERRAL_ID);
        _rsETHAmt = RSETH.balanceOf(address(this)) - _rsETHAmt;

        if (_rsETHAmt == 0) revert InvariantViolation();

        return stakeAmount;
    }
```

The first parameter is supposed to be used for slippage control, but Napier hardcoded the value to `0` resulting no restrictions over the amount of `rsETH` minted by the function. Because of this the user trying to stake `ETH` in the Napier protocol could end up receiving less/more `PT`/`YT` tokens than expected.

## Impact
Users staking via the `RsETHAdapter` have no control over the slippage they will be subject to, which can lead to them receiving less/more `PT`/`YT` tokens than expeced.

## Recommendation
Implement slippage control in the `RsETHAdapter` adapter.
