# The revert of _stake will cause many functions of the protocol to be unavailable.

## Summary
_stake is the core function of protocol staking. The revert of stake may cause users to be unable to stake, and may also cause errors in many functions in the router.

## Vulnerability Detail
Errors in _stake are generally due to certain restrictions in the staking agreement, but these restrictions are almost always temporary. Therefore, even if there is an error in _stake, it should not prevent users from staking and should not affect the normal functions of the protocol. Protocol can wait until the next time the user pledges before calling _stake. Therefore, can use try to call stake to ensure the stable operation of the protocol.

## Impact
This may result in the agreement being unable to be issue.
