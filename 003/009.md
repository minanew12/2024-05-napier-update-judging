# Any queued withdrawal from EtherFi adapter cannot be claimed

## Summary
Due to incorrect validation on `_requestId`, the EETHAdapter `claimWithdrawal()` function always reverts. As a consequences, any queued withdrawal cannot be completed further. 
## Vulnerability Detail
`EETHAdapter.claimWithdrawal()` checks whether the `_requestId` is finalized by the admin of the `EtherFi.WithdrawRequestNFT` contract or not. If not, reverts the `claimWithdrawal()` call which obviously makes sense. 

However, if the `_requestId` is [finalized](https://github.com/etherfi-protocol/smart-contracts/blob/4160ada6203f83e7cf776cc94eb3bb8eeccf0076/src/WithdrawRequestNFT.sol#L136-L138) by the EtherFi admin, the lastFinalizedRequestId is set to the `_requestId`, also means any requestId `<= lastFinalziedRequestId` can [claimWithdrawal()](https://github.com/etherfi-protocol/smart-contracts/blob/4160ada6203f83e7cf776cc94eb3bb8eeccf0076/src/WithdrawRequestNFT.sol#L70). The issue is that the Napier `EETHAdapter` reverses this check, causing every finalized request from EtherFi to be treated as under inspection or not claimable yet. Therefore, it reverts.

```solidity
        // If _requstId is finalized on etherfi, it's reverted.
        if (_requestId < ETHERFI_WITHDRAW_NFT.lastFinalizedRequestId()) revert RequestInQueue();
```
## Impact
The [WithdrawRequestNFT.claimWithdraw()](https://github.com/etherfi-protocol/smart-contracts/blob/4160ada6203f83e7cf776cc94eb3bb8eeccf0076/src/WithdrawRequestNFT.sol#L88) method only allows the owner of the requestId to claim the amount, which, in this case, is the Napier EtherFi adapter. Since, the adapter claim function always reverts above, funds stuck forever into the EtherFi `LiquidityPool` ,

## Recommendation
```diff
        // If _requstId is finalized on etherfi, it's reverted.
-        if (_requestId < ETHERFI_WITHDRAW_NFT.lastFinalizedRequestId()) revert RequestInQueue();
+        if (_requestId > ETHERFI_WITHDRAW_NFT.lastFinalizedRequestId()) revert RequestInQueue();
