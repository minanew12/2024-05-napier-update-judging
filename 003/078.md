# EETHAdapter.claimWithdrawal() uses a wrong condition and it doesn't work in most cases

## Summary
`EETHAdapter.claimWithdrawal()` validates a wrong condition and the function doesn't work in most cases consequently.

## Vulnerability Detail

`EETHAdapter.claimWithdrawal()` checks if `_requestId` is finalized on etherfi as follows:

```solidity
EETHAdapter.sol
63:         if (_requestId < ETHERFI_WITHDRAW_NFT.lastFinalizedRequestId()) revert RequestInQueue();

```

After that `EETHAdapter.claimWithdrawal()` claims withdrawal using `ETHERFI_WITHDRAW_NFT.claimWithdraw()`. And then `ETHERFI_WITHDRAW_NFT.claimWithdraw()` calls `ETHERFI_WITHDRAW_NFT.getClaimableAmount()` internally, and `ETHERFI_WITHDRAW_NFT.getClaimableAmount()` also checks if the request id is finalized.

```solidity
WithdrawRequestNFT.sol
87:    function claimWithdraw(uint256 tokenId) public {

92:        uint256 amountToWithdraw = getClaimableAmount(tokenId);
```

```solidity
WithdrawRequestNFT.sol

68:    function getClaimableAmount(uint256 tokenId) public view returns (uint256) {

70:        require(tokenId <= lastFinalizedRequestId, "Request is not finalized");
```

As we can see from here, the finalized token id should be equal or less than    `lastFinalizedRequestId`. So the condition used in `EETHAdapter.claimWithdrawal()` is not correct. As a result, `EETHAdapter.claimWithdrawal()` works only when `_requestId = ETHERFI_WITHDRAW_NFT.lastFinalizedRequestId`, and this is not the intended behavior.

## Impact
`EETHAdapter.claimWithdrawal()` works only when `_requestId = ETHERFI_WITHDRAW_NFT.lastFinalizedRequestId`, and doesn't work in most cases.

https://github.com/etherfi-protocol/smart-contracts/blob/master/src/WithdrawRequestNFT.sol#L68-L70

## Recommendation
The `_requestId` should be larger than `lastFinalizedRequestId`.

```solidity
 - if (_requestId < ETHERFI_WITHDRAW_NFT.lastFinalizedRequestId()) revert RequestInQueue();
 + if (_requestId > ETHERFI_WITHDRAW_NFT.lastFinalizedRequestId()) revert RequestInQueue();
```
