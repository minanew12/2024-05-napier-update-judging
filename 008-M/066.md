# Users can frontrun LSTs/LRTs tokens price increase in order to capture extra value

## Summary

Users can frontrun the price increase of a supported LSTs/LRTs tokens in order to capture value.

## Vulnerability Detail

Napier allows users to deposit `ETH` into supported LSTs/LRTs protocols via adapters in exchange for shares in the form of `PT` and `YT` tokens. The in-scope LSDs/LRTs protocols that can be deposited into are:

- Etherfi, via [EETHAdapter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/main/napier-v1/src/adapters/etherfi/EETHAdapter.sol)
- Bedrock, via [UniEthAdapter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/main/napier-v1/src/adapters/bedrock/UniETHAdapter.sol)
- Puffer, via [PufETHAdapter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/main/napier-uups-adapters/src/adapters/puffer/PufETHAdapter.sol)
- Renzo, via [RenzoAdapter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/main/napier-uups-adapters/src/adapters/renzo/RenzoAdapter.sol)
- Kelp, via [RsETHAdapter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/main/napier-uups-adapters/src/adapters/kelp/RsETHAdapter.sol)
- Swell, via [RswETHAdapter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/main/napier-uups-adapters/src/adapters/swell/RswETHAdapter.sol)

All of them can be subject to an instant increase in their shares value (or shares balance), mainly due to beacon chain validator rewards.

Napier allows users to deposit `ETH` in the protocol in exchange for `PT` and `YT` tokens instantly, without being subject to a deposit queue. This allows an attacker to frontrun a price/balance increase by doing the following:

1. Monitor the supported LSTs/LRTs protocols and the beacon chain for an imminent share price/balance increase.
2. Frontrun the share price/balance increase by depositing `ETH` in the relative LST/LRT protocol adapter via [Tranche::issue()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/main/napier-v1/src/Tranche.sol#L163), which will call [BaseLSTAdapter::prefundedDeposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/main/napier-v1/src/adapters/BaseLSTAdapter.sol#L80)/[BaseLSTAdapterUpgradeable::prefundedDeposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/main/napier-uups-adapters/src/adapters/BaseLSTAdapterUpgradeable.sol#L81), in exchange for `PT` and `YT`tokens.
3. Wait for the share price increase to take effect, which will increase the TVL of the adapter (in terms of ETH) and in turn the value of the `PT` and `YT` tokens.
4. Call [Tranche::redeemWithYT()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/main/napier-v1/src/Tranche.sol#L231), which will internally call [BaseLSTAdapter::prefundedRedeem()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/main/napier-v1/src/adapters/BaseLSTAdapter.sol#L168)/[BaseLSTAdapterUpgradeable::prefundedRedeem()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/main/napier-uups-adapters/src/adapters/BaseLSTAdapterUpgradeable.sol#L171), to redeem `PT`/`YT` in exchange of `ETH`. This is currently only possible for the [EETHAdapter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/main/napier-v1/src/adapters/etherfi/EETHAdapter.sol) and the [UniEthAdapter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/main/napier-v1/src/adapters/bedrock/UniETHAdapter.sol) adapters.

This allows an attacker to capture profit while not being subject to the risks of staking.

On some adapters the function that triggers the price increase it's permissionless, which allows an attacker to execute all of the series of calls listed above atomically. One example of such adapter is the Renzo adapter, in which the price increase of `ezETH` shares (the Renzo token) is triggered by a call to [DelayedWithdrawalRouter::claimDelayedWithdrawals()](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/v0.2.3-mainnet-m2/src/contracts/pods/DelayedWithdrawalRouter.sol#L100) on Eigenlayer.

## Impact

An attacker can frontrun an imminent price/balance increase of a supported LSD/LRT token in order to capture value, which translates into hontest Napier stakers earning less than they should.

## Recommendation

Introduce a deposit queue, this prevents an attacker from frontrunning price increases for profit.
