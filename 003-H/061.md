# Funds may not be withdrawn due to a check error

## Summary
In the claimWithdrawal function,[ the contract will check _requestId](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/c31af59c6399182fd04b40530d79d98632d2bfa7/napier-v1/src/adapters/etherfi/EETHAdapter.sol#L63), but the error in judgment here means that unless _requestId == ETHERFI_WITHDRAW_NFT.lastFinalizedRequestId(), the protocol will never be able to claim.

## Vulnerability Detail
The following judgments are made in the contract
```solidity
        if (_requestId < ETHERFI_WITHDRAW_NFT.lastFinalizedRequestId()) revert RequestInQueue();
```
This judgment means that if the latest finalized id is larger than _requestId, revet.

This is exactly the opposite of the meaning of ETHERFI_WITHDRAW_NFT. The judgment in ETHERFI_WITHDRAW_NFT is as follows
```solidity
        require(tokenId <= lastFinalizedRequestId, "Request is not finalized");
```
Therefore, the error in judgment here causes the withdrawal to be locked once the opportunity for _requestId == ETHERFI_WITHDRAW_NFT.lastFinalizedRequestId() is missed. This is highly likely to happen.

## Impact
The protocol may not be able to withdraw funds resulting in loss of funds.

## Recommendation
```diff
-        if (_requestId < ETHERFI_WITHDRAW_NFT.lastFinalizedRequestId()) revert RequestInQueue();
+        if (_requestId > ETHERFI_WITHDRAW_NFT.lastFinalizedRequestId()) revert RequestInQueue();
```
