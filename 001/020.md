# `UniETHAdapter#_stake()` , `RsETHAdapter#_stake()` & `UniETHAdapter#_requestWithdrawal()` all lack any slippage or deadline mechanism whatsoever


## Summary

Multiple adapters including e `UniETHAdapter.sol` contract, includes functions like `_stake` and `_requestWithdrawal` that directly interact with the `BEDROCK_STAKING` contract, but lack proper slippage and deadline protections, making them susceptible to attacks... see _Vulnerability Detail_ for more details.

## Vulnerability Detail

Take a look at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/c31af59c6399182fd04b40530d79d98632d2bfa7/napier-v1/src/adapters/bedrock/UniETHAdapter.sol#L73-L83

```solidity
    function _stake(uint256 stakeAmount) internal override returns (uint256) {
        if (stakeAmount == 0) return 0;

        IWETH9(Constants.WETH).withdraw(stakeAmount);
        uint256 _balance = UNIETH.balanceOf(address(this));
        BEDROCK_STAKING.mint{value: stakeAmount}({minToMint: 0, deadline: block.timestamp + 1});//@audit
        uint256 minted = UNIETH.balanceOf(address(this)) - _balance;
        if (minted == 0) revert InvariantViolation();

        return stakeAmount;
    }
```

And https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/c31af59c6399182fd04b40530d79d98632d2bfa7/napier-v1/src/adapters/bedrock/UniETHAdapter.sol#L141-L163

```solidity
    function _requestWithdrawal(uint256 withdrawAmount) internal override returns (uint256, uint256) {
        // Check whether adapter has any pending request. Only one request is allowed at a time.
        if (totalQueueEth > 0) revert RequestInQueue();

        // They can only allow withdrawal in multiples of 32 eth
        withdrawAmount -= (withdrawAmount % 32 ether);
        if (withdrawAmount == 0) revert InvalidWithdrawalAmount();
        /// INTERACT ///
        // Bedrock burns some uniETH from the balance of this adapter and tracks the debt.
        (, uint256 requestId) = BEDROCK_STAKING.getDebtQueue();
        requestId++; // Next debt index
        uint256 debtPrior = BEDROCK_STAKING.debtOf(address(this));
        BEDROCK_STAKING.redeemFromValidators({
            ethersToRedeem: withdrawAmount,
            maxToBurn: type(uint256).max,//@audit
            deadline: block.timestamp + 1
        });
        if (BEDROCK_STAKING.debtOf(address(this)) != debtPrior + withdrawAmount) revert InvariantViolation();

        emit RequestWithdrawal(requestId, withdrawAmount);
        return (withdrawAmount, requestId);
    }

```

Both instances query the `BEDROCK_STAKING` contract and interact with the `mint()` and `redeemFromValidators()` functions, these are specified here: https://github.com/Bedrock-Technology/stake/blob/6661b235d646cab547961b163f53e9155e31fa42/src/contracts/rockx_staking.sol

Going to the implementations of [the `rockx_staking#mint()`](https://github.com/Bedrock-Technology/stake/blob/6661b235d646cab547961b163f53e9155e31fa42/src/contracts/rockx_staking.sol#L940-L943), we can see that the `minToMint` value is used as a slippage, `        _require(toMint >= minToMint, "USR004");`, would be key to note that from the snippet we can see that the amount that finally gets minted is heavily[ dependent on the reserves](https://github.com/Bedrock-Technology/stake/blob/6661b235d646cab547961b163f53e9155e31fa42/src/contracts/rockx_staking.sol#L932) and [the current total supply](https://github.com/Bedrock-Technology/stake/blob/6661b235d646cab547961b163f53e9155e31fa42/src/contracts/rockx_staking.sol#L931) which means that any one could route their calls to the `rockx_staking.sol` contract to game the call via this context, since it's MEV-exploitable, considering no active deadline is also being applied.

Also, going to the implementations of [the `rockx_staking#redeemFromValidators()`]](https://github.com/Bedrock-Technology/stake/blob/6661b235d646cab547961b163f53e9155e31fa42/src/contracts/rockx_staking.sol#L963-L986) we can see that `maxToBurn` is used as a slippage checker, i.e `_require(xETHToBurn <= maxToBurn, "USR004");`, so hardcoding this value as ` type(uint256).max,` means that this attempt at redemption is going to pass no matter the amount of `uniETH` that gets burnt from the adapter.

Keep in mind that both of these implementations also lack any deadline implementation whatsoever, since the deadlines have been hardcoded as ` block.timestamp + 1` in both instances, showcasing that this transaction could linger for whatever duration in the mempool and still be percieved as valid, due to the heavy dependence on ` block.timestamp`.

The same bug idea is also applicable to this instance in the `RsETHAdapter`, albeit here we only consider the lack of slippage https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-napier-update/blob/c31af59c6399182fd04b40530d79d98632d2bfa7/napier-uups-adapters/src/adapters/kelp/RsETHAdapter.sol#L84

```solidity
        RSETH_DEPOSIT_POOL.depositETH{value: stakeAmount}(0, REFERRAL_ID);
```
## Impact

High, no effective slippage/deadline protection applied for amounts received from staking or withdrawing attempts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider applying both slippage and deadline protections to queries to the the `rockx_staking.sol` contract when necessary.
